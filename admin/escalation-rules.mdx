## Escalation Overview

Escalation rules automatically promote claims up the chain when needed.

### When to Escalate

- Claim approaching SLA deadline
- No one assigned after X hours
- Critical priority not addressed
- Safety concern requires executive review
- Cross-department issue needs coordination

## Creating Escalation Rules

1. Admin Console → **Escalation Rules**
2. Click **"Add Rule"**
3. Set trigger conditions:
   - Priority = Critical
   - Category = Safety
   - Open > 2 hours without assignment
4. Set escalation action:
   - Escalate to manager
   - Escalate to director
   - Notify department head
5. Save and test

## Common Escalation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unassigned Critical Claims

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Priority = Critical AND no assignment after 1 hour
- Action: Escalate to Department Manager

**Effect**: Ensures critical claims get attention quickly

### Scenario 2: SLA At-Risk Claims

**Rule:**
- Trigger: SLA status = At-Risk (2 hours before deadline)
- Action: Notify assignee + add to manager dashboard

**Effect**: Proactive intervention before deadline missed

### Scenario 3: Safety Claims

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Category = Safety AND Priority = High
- Action:
  - Auto-escalate to Safety Manager
  - Email Safety Officer
  - Copy Executive Director

**Effect**: Safety gets priority treatment

### Scenario 4: Cross-Department Issues

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Comments mention multiple departments
- Action: Escalate to Operations Director

**Effect**: Executive aligns departments

## Escalation Chain

Define multi-level escalation:

```
Level 1: Assigned person works on it
    ↓ (if not assigned in 2 hours)
Level 2: Department manager notified
    ↓ (if still not resolved in 4 hours)
Level 3: Operations director takes over
    ↓ (if still open next day)
Level 4: Executive review for process change
```

## Managing Escalations

### Preventing Escalations

Better to prevent than escalate:
- More resources upfront
- Clear procedures
- Better training
- Process improvements

### Responding to Escalations

When escalated:
1. Drop what you're doing
2. Prioritize over routine work
3. Get help if needed
4. Update status frequently
5. Report resolution quickly

## Monitoring Escalations

Dashboard shows:
- How many escalations per week
- Which rules trigger most
- Escalation success rate
- Patterns in escalations

High escalation rate suggests:
- Insufficient resources
- Process issues
- Unclear procedures
- Need for training
