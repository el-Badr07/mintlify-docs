## SLA Overview

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) define deadlines for handling claims.

### SLA Components

**Response Time**: How quickly must claim be acknowledged/assigned
- Example: Critical = 4 hours
- Example: Low = 48 hours

**Resolution Time**: How quickly must claim be fully resolved
- Example: Critical = 8 hours
- Example: Low = 1 week

### Default SLA Policy

| Priority | Response | Resolution | Escalation |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 8 hours | 2 hours if not assigned |
| High | 8 hours | 24 hours | 4 hours if not assigned |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours | Escalate if at-risk |
| Low | 48 hours | 1 week | Manual review |

## Customizing SLAs

1. Admin Console → **SLA Policies**
2. Select priority level
3. Set response time
4. Set resolution time
5. Configure escalation triggers
6. Save and test

### By Priority

Set different rules for Critical/High/Medium/Low priorities.

### By Category

Override SLAs for specific categories:
- Safety claims: May need faster response
- Equipment maintenance: May need extra time for parts
- Logistics: May have different timelines

### By Department

Different departments may have different capabilities:
- Well-staffed department: Shorter SLAs possible
- Under-resourced department: Longer SLAs needed

## Exclusions

Configure when SLA clock stops:
- Weekends (if applicable)
- Holidays
- Business hours only
- Maintenance windows

Example: "Resolve by Monday 9 AM" when claim created Friday 5 PM.

## Escalation Rules

Automatic escalation when SLA at risk:
- At 2 hours remaining: Yellow warning
- At deadline: Red alert, notify manager
- 1 hour overdue: Escalate to director

## SLA Monitoring

Dashboard shows:
- SLA compliance rate
- Claims at-risk or overdue
- Department SLA performance
- Category SLA comparison

## Tips

- **Start conservative**: Longer SLAs initially
- **Monitor actual performance**: Adjust based on data
- **Different for different categories**: Manufacturing vs logistics differ
- **Account for complexity**: Complex issues may need more time
- **Regular review**: Quarterly adjustment keeps SLAs realistic
