## Creating Departments

Departments organize your manufacturing teams and define how claims are routed.

### Standard Departments

Default departments included:
- **PRODUCTION**: Manufacturing floor operations
- **QUALITY_CONTROL**: Quality assurance team
- **MAINTENANCE**: Equipment maintenance
- **LOGISTICS**: Shipping and supply chain
- **SAFETY**: Safety and compliance
- **HR**: Human resources

### Adding Custom Departments

1. Go to **Admin Console** → **Organization**
2. Click **"Add Department"**
3. Enter department name
4. Assign department manager
5. Configure SLA rules for department
6. Enable department in system

## Department Configuration

### Manager Assignment

Assign one or more managers to oversee department:
- Primary manager: Main escalation point
- Backup manager: Coverage for absences
- Managers see all department claims
- Department metrics show in their dashboard

### Department-Specific SLA

Set different deadlines per department:
- Safety claims: 4-hour response (higher priority)
- Quality claims: 8-hour response
- Maintenance claims: 12-hour response (may need parts)
- Logistics claims: 6-hour response

### Team Members

- Assign employees to department
- Employees see only their department's work
- Managers see all team members' claims
- Capacity planning per department

## Department Analytics

Monitor department performance:
- Total claims in department
- Average resolution time
- SLA compliance rate
- Workload per person
- Category breakdown
- Trend analysis

## Department Hierarchies

For larger organizations, create hierarchies:
- Parent department: Production
  - Sub-department: Line 1
  - Sub-department: Line 2
  - Sub-department: Line 3

Claims flow to most specific department.
