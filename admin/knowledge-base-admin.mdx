## Knowledge Base Overview

The knowledge base is a central repository of documentation that:
- Trains AI assistants
- Prevents re-learning past solutions
- Guides team members
- Improves AI accuracy

## Knowledge Base Content

### Standard Operating Procedures
- Manufacturing processes
- Safety protocols
- Equipment operation
- Emergency procedures

### Troubleshooting Guides
- Common equipment issues
- How to diagnose problems
- Step-by-step solutions
- When to escalate

### Historical Resolutions
- Past similar claims
- Solutions that worked
- Lessons learned
- Best practices

### Reference Materials
- Equipment specifications
- Supplier information
- Standards compliance
- Contact directories

## Adding Documents

1. Admin Console → **Knowledge Base**
2. Click **"Upload Document"**
3. Choose file (PDF, Word, markdown)
4. Add metadata:
   - Title
   - Department (Quality, Maintenance, etc.)
   - Category (Procedure, Guide, Reference)
   - Tags (for search)
5. Save

## Bulk Import

For large content uploads:
1. Prepare documents in folder
2. Zip file collection
3. Upload zip to Knowledge Base
4. System extracts and indexes
5. Organize by department

## Document Management

### Organizing Documents
- By department (Quality, Maintenance, etc.)
- By category (Procedures, Guides, etc.)
- By topic (Equipment, Safety, etc.)
- By date (chronological updates)

### Version Control
- Keep one "current" version
- Archive old versions
- Note what changed
- Track last update date

### Access Control
- Department can view own procedures
- Managers can view all
- Admins can view/edit all
- Some documents marked confidential

### Search & Retrieval
- Full-text search
- Tag-based search
- Department filter
- Recently updated highlight

## Knowledge Base Analytics

Track:
- Most viewed documents
- Documents agents use most
- Search query patterns
- Knowledge gaps (searched but not found)

Use analytics to:
- Add missing documentation
- Update outdated content
- Identify training needs
- Improve AI performance

## Keeping Knowledge Base Current

### Monthly Review
- Update changed procedures
- Remove outdated content
- Add new learnings
- Fix broken links

### Quarterly Audit
- Verify all procedures current
- Identify gaps
- Reorganize if needed
- Archive old versions

### When Processes Change
- Update relevant documents immediately
- Notify team of changes
- Retrain AI if needed
- Add to changelog

## Knowledge Base Impact

Good knowledge base results in:
- ✅ Faster issue resolution
- ✅ Better AI classification
- ✅ Fewer repeated errors
- ✅ Improved team training
- ✅ More consistent processes
