## Claim Categories

Categories organize claims by type. Customize them to match your manufacturing operations.

### Default Categories

- **Quality**: Defects, quality issues, product problems
- **Safety**: Incidents, hazards, safety concerns
- **Logistics**: Shipping, supply chain, delivery issues
- **Maintenance**: Equipment problems, repairs needed
- **Other**: Miscellaneous issues

### Creating Custom Categories

1. Admin Console → **Categories**
2. Click **"Add Category"**
3. Enter category name (e.g., "Environmental")
4. Set description
5. Assign to departments
6. Configure category-specific SLA
7. Save and test

### Best Practices

- **5-10 categories maximum**: Too many confuses users
- **Clear naming**: Use your operational terminology
- **Minimize "Other"**: Every claim should fit clear category
- **Department alignment**: Categories match department structure
- **Regular review**: Adjust based on claim patterns

## Category Mapping

Map categories to departments for auto-routing:

**Example:**
- Quality category → Route to Quality department
- Safety category → Route to Safety + notify manager
- Maintenance category → Route to Maintenance specialist
- Logistics category → Route to Logistics team

## Category-Specific SLA

Set different SLAs per category:

| Category | Response Time | Resolution Time | Why |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| Safety | 4 hours | 8 hours | Critical |
| Quality | 8 hours | 24 hours | Important |
| Maintenance | 12 hours | 48 hours | Slow delivery |
| Logistics | 6 hours | 24 hours | Supply chain |

- SLA compliance by category
- Most common causes
- Trend analysis

Identify which categories have issues and improve processes.
