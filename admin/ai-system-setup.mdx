## AI Configuration Overview

Configure how AI behaves for your organization.

## LLM Provider Selection

Choose which AI model to use:

### OpenRouter (Default - Cost-Effective)
- Model: Nemotron Nano 12B V2 VL
- Cost: Free tier available, pay-per-use
- Speed: Fast processing
- Quality: Good for classification
- When to use: Most claims (budget-conscious)

### Groq (Audio Processing)
- Model: Whisper Large V3 Turbo
- Cost: Pay-per-use
- Speed: Real-time transcription
- Quality: Excellent audio
- When to use: All voice claims

### OpenAI (Premium)
- Model: GPT-4, GPT-4 Vision
- Cost: Premium pricing
- Speed: Varies
- Quality: Best accuracy
- When to use: Critical classifications, complex analysis

## Configuration Settings

### Classification Confidence Threshold

Set minimum confidence for AI suggestions:
- **High threshold (>80%)**: Only very confident suggestions
  - Pro: Fewer wrong classifications
  - Con: More claims need manual review

- **Medium threshold (>60%)**: Balanced approach
  - Pro: Good automation, reasonable accuracy
  - Con: Some errors possible

- **Low threshold (>40%)**: Aggressive automation
  - Pro: Minimal manual work
  - Con: More corrections needed

### Priority Assignment Rules

Configure how AI assigns priority:
- Critical: Safety concerns, urgent keywords
- High: Major issues, equipment down
- Medium: Standard issues
- Low: Routine items

### Root Cause Categories

Define the root cause options:
1. Equipment failure
2. Training gap
3. Process error
4. Supplier issue
5. Material defect
6. Environmental
7. Maintenance backlog
8. Communication breakdown
9. Human error

## Testing AI Configuration

1. Create sample claims with various inputs
2. Review AI classifications
3. Check confidence scores
4. Note any pattern errors
5. Adjust configuration if needed
6. Retest until satisfied

## Monitoring AI Performance

Track:
- Classification accuracy
- Override rate (how often users change AI suggestion)
- Processing time
- Cost per claim
- User satisfaction

High override rate suggests:
- AI needs retraining
- Thresholds need adjustment
- Categories not clear
- Process needs change

## Disabling AI Features

If AI not working well:
- Disable auto-classification
- Use manual categorization
- Revisit AI configuration
- Check sample claims
- Adjust thresholds
