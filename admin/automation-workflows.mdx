## Automation Overview

Automate repetitive tasks to save time and reduce manual errors.

## Types of Automation

### Auto-Routing
Automatically send claims to correct department:
- If category = Quality → Route to Quality
- If safety concern → Route to Safety + Manager
- If vendor issue → Route to Procurement

### Auto-Assignment
Automatically assign to specific person:
- If Quality claim → Assign to John (quality lead)
- If maintenance → Round-robin among mechanics
- If critical → Auto-assign to manager

### Auto-Notification
Automatically notify relevant people:
- If critical → Email entire department
- If safety → @mention Safety Officer
- If escalated → Notify director

### Auto-Status-Update
Automatically update status:
- If resolved and approved → Auto-close after 24 hours
- If overdue → Flag automatically
- If at-risk → Add to priority board

## Creating Workflows

1. Admin Console → **Workflows**
2. Click **"Add Workflow"**
3. Define trigger:
   - When new claim created
   - When status changes
   - When time passes
   - When comment added
4. Define conditions:
   - If category = X
   - If priority = Y
   - If assigned to Z
5. Define actions:
   - Route to department
   - Assign to person
   - Send notification
   - Update status
6. Test workflow
7. Enable for all users

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Quality Claims Fast Track

**Trigger**: New claim created
**Condition**: Category = Quality AND Priority >= High
**Actions**:
1. Route to Quality department
2. Assign to Sarah (quality lead)
3. Add to "Red Flag" report
4. Notify quality manager
**Result**: High-priority quality issues handled immediately

### Example 2: Preventive Maintenance

**Trigger**: Resolved claim
**Condition**: Category = Maintenance AND same equipment as past 2 claims
**Actions**:
1. Flag as "recurring issue"
2. Create improvement task
3. Notify maintenance supervisor
4. Link to knowledge base article
**Result**: Recurring problems detected and addressed

### Example 3: Safety Escalation

**Trigger**: New claim OR comment added
**Condition**: Keyword = "injury" OR Category = Safety
**Actions**:
1. Auto-escalate to Safety Manager
2. Email Safety Officer
3. Copy CEO
4. Create audit trail
5. Lock claim from editing (immutable history)
**Result**: Safety incidents get executive attention

## Best Practices

- **Start simple**: One rule at a time
- **Test first**: Run on sample claims
- **Monitor results**: Check if working as intended
- **Adjust frequently**: Fine-tune based on usage
- **Document**: Keep list of active workflows
- **Avoid conflicts**: Different rules shouldn't contradict
- **Review regularly**: Disable unused workflows

## Troubleshooting

**Workflow not triggering?**
- Check conditions are correct
- Verify trigger happening
- Test with manual claim

**Too many notifications?**
- Adjust notification frequency
- Add conditions to reduce triggers
- Consolidate into digests

**Wrong routing?**
- Check condition logic
- Verify department assignments
- Review rule priority order
