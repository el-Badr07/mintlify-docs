## Part 1: Organization & User Setup (Admins)

### Step 1: Create Your Organization

1. **Access the Auth Service signup page**
2. **Choose to create a new organization**:
   - Organization name (e.g., "Acme Manufacturing")
   - This creates an organization in Keycloak and Reclamia
3. **Fill in your details**:
   - Username
   - Email address
   - Password (8+ characters)
   - Full name
4. **Automatic login** occurs after signup
5. You're now the **Organization Admin**

### Step 2: Configure Keycloak (Organization Admin)

Keycloak is where roles and users are managed enterprise-wide.

1. **Access Keycloak Admin Console**:
   - URL: `https://api.64.226.86.247.sslip.io/keycloak`
   - Login with your admin credentials
2. **Review available roles** (already configured):
   - `admin` → Full system access
   - `manager` → Team and department oversight
   - `employee` → Claim creation and collaboration
3. **Create additional custom roles** if needed for your organization
4. **Note**: User authentication is managed in Keycloak, not in Reclamia

### Step 3: Add Team Members (Organization Admin)

**Method 1: Via Keycloak Admin Console**

1. **In Keycloak Console**, select your realm
2. **Navigate to Users** section
3. **Create new user**:
   - Username
   - Email
   - First name, Last name
   - Mark "Email Verified" if desired
4. **Set temporary password** (user must change on first login)
5. **Assign roles** (ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE):
   - Go to Role Mappings tab
   - Add roles from "Realm Roles" section
6. User receives **email invitation** and **sets permanent password**

**Method 2: Users Join via Self-Signup**

1. Users visit the **signup page**
2. Select your organization from the list
3. Create account with username, email, password
4. Join with **EMPLOYEE** role by default
5. Admin can **promote roles** in Keycloak later

### Step 4: Configure Organization in Reclamia

1. **Login to Reclamia** with your admin credentials
2. **Go to Settings** → **Organization**
3. **Set up departments** (if not already configured):
   - PRODUCTION
   - QUALITY_CONTROL
   - MAINTENANCE
   - LOGISTICS
   - SAFETY
   - HR (or custom)
4. **Create custom categories** for your claim types
5. **Set default SLA policies**:
   - Critical: 4-hour response, 8-hour resolution
   - High: 8-hour response, 24-hour resolution
   - Medium: 24-hour response, 72-hour resolution
   - Low: 48-hour response, 1-week resolution

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Login?

- **Check Keycloak status**: Ensure Keycloak is running at `https://api.64.226.86.247.sslip.io/keycloak`
- **Verify credentials**: Double-check username and password
- **Check email**: Verify you received the signup confirmation
- **Password reset**: Use "Forgot Password" link

### Role Not Showing?

- **Verify in Keycloak**: Check that role is assigned in Keycloak Admin Console
- **Try logging out**: Logout and login again to refresh roles
- **Clear cache**: Browser cache might show old role information

### Can't Assign User?

- **Verify department**: Both users must be in same organization
- **Check role**: Users need MANAGER+ role to assign claims
- **Verify user added**: Confirm the user actually exists in system

### Voice Transcription Issues?

- **Check audio quality**: Ensure quiet environment
- **Use clear speech**: Speak clearly without background noise
- **Try again**: Groq might need retry for processing
