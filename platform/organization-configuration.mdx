## Organization Settings

Configure your organization to match your business structure and needs.

### Department Management

Create departments matching your organizational structure:

**Default departments:**
- PRODUCTION
- QUALITY_CONTROL
- MAINTENANCE
- LOGISTICS
- SAFETY
- HR

**To add custom department:**
1. Admin Console → Organization
2. Departments section
3. Add new department
4. Assign manager
5. Configure SLA rules for department

**Benefits:**
- Claims route to correct team
- Team sees only their claims
- Workload visibility
- Performance tracking per department

### Claim Categories

Define what types of claims you accept:

**Customize categories:**
1. Admin Console → Categories
2. Edit default or create new
3. Assign to departments
4. Set category-specific SLA

**Best practices:**
- 5-10 categories (not too many)
- Clear naming
- Exclude "Other" when possible
- Match your business terms

### SLA Policies

Configure response and resolution deadlines:

**Per priority level:**
| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| High | 8 hours | 24 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours |
| Low | 48 hours | 1 week |

**Customize for your needs:**
- Safety claims may need 4-hour response
- Maintenance may need 24-hour response
- Logistics may exclude weekends

### Notification Settings

Control how team is notified:
- Email on assignment
- Email on escalation
- Email on resolution
- Dashboard notifications

## Business Rules

Create automatic routing and escalation:

**Example rules:**
- If category = Quality → Route to Quality dept
- If priority = Critical → Notify manager
- If assigned > 8 hours → Escalate

See [Business Rules](/platform/business-rules-automation) for details.
