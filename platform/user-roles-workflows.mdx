## Cross-Functional Collaboration

- **Complete activity log** tracks all involvement

### Example: Quality + Logistics Issue

1. **Employee creates claim**: "Damaged product in shipment"
2. **AI routes**: "Quality" (suggested category)
3. **Quality Manager assigns**: To Quality specialist
4. **Quality specialist comments**: "@Logistics Can you confirm shipping damage?"
5. **Logistics Manager sees** the @mention notification
6. **Logistics specialist joins** the conversation
