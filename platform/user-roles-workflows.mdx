## Role Synchronization

### How Roles Work

1. **Defined in Keycloak**: Roles (admin, manager, employee) are created and configured in Keycloak realm
2. **Assigned to Users**: When creating/modifying users in Keycloak, admin assigns one or more roles
3. **Synced on Login**: When user logs in, Keycloak passes roles in JWT token
4. **Kong Validates**: Kong Gateway validates JWT and passes roles to backend
5. **Intelligate Receives**: Backend reads roles from Kong headers and syncs to user record
6. **Interface Adapts**: Intelligate shows role-appropriate interface

### Changing Roles

**Process when role changes:**

1. **Admin edits user in Keycloak**:
   - Remove "employee" role
   - Add "manager" role
2. **User logs out** or sessions expires
3. **User logs back in**
4. **New role** automatically reflected in Intelligate
5. **Interface updates** to show manager capabilities
6. **Changed immediately** - no Intelligate admin action needed

---

## Cross-Functional Collaboration

Even with role restrictions, teams collaborate effectively:

- **Employees create claims** that route to appropriate managers
- **Managers can involve specialists** from other departments via comments
- **Comments with @mentions** notify cross-department people
- **Escalations elevate to ADMIN** for organization-wide issues
- **Complete activity log** tracks all involvement

### Example: Quality + Logistics Issue

1. **Employee creates claim**: "Damaged product in shipment"
2. **AI routes**: "Quality" (suggested category)
3. **Quality Manager assigns**: To Quality specialist
4. **Quality specialist comments**: "@Logistics Can you confirm shipping damage?"
5. **Logistics Manager sees** the @mention notification
6. **Logistics specialist joins** the conversation
7. **Teams collaborate** to determine if Quality or Logistics issue
8. **Resolution addresses both** departments' concerns
