## Part 1: Creating Claims

### Text Claims

**Best for**: Detailed descriptions, desk-based reporting, complex situations

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Click "New Claim"** -> Select **"Text"**
2. **Enter claim details**:
   - **Title**: Brief summary (e.g., "Assembly line conveyor misalignment")
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation with context
   - **Category**: Quality, Safety, Logistics, Maintenance, or custom
   - **Department**: Which department should handle this
   - **Attach files** (optional): Upload supporting documents
3. **Submit**

**What happens automatically:**
- Intelligate analyzes text and predicts category (AI may override your selection)
- Priority assigned (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Sent to appropriate department
- You see the claim on dashboard immediately

**Tips for better AI classification:**
- Use specific, clear language
- Include relevant details (what, where, when)
- Mention if issue is recurring
- Note any safety concerns in description
- List any affected equipment or people

### Voice Claims

**Best for**: On-site quick capture, hands-free reporting, time-sensitive issues

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Click "New Claim"** -> Select **"Voice"**
2. **Click microphone icon** and start recording
3. **Speak clearly** for 15-60 seconds:
   - Describe what you see/experienced
   - What's affected or who's involved
   - Any immediate actions taken
   - Example: "Found water leak near Circuit Panel 3 on Line 4, shut off power, area marked unsafe"
4. **Stop recording** when done
5. **Groq Whisper transcribes** automatically (usually within seconds)
6. **Review transcription**:
   - Is it accurate? If not, edit text
   - Add additional context if needed
7. **Select category** (or accept AI suggestion)
8. **Submit**

**What happens:**
- Your voice automatically converted to text
- Text analyzed for category and priority
- Transcription sometimes needs minor edits (background noise, accents)
- Claim created with full audio and transcription

**Tips for better voice capture:**
- Speak clearly without rush
- Use production floor language (team will understand)
- Include "where" information
- Mention time sensitivity
- Note if immediate action needed

**Technical details:**
- Uses Groq Whisper Large V3 Turbo
- Supports noisy environments
- Best with 15-60 second recordings
- Multiple languages supported (trained on your usage)

### Image Claims

**Best for**: Visual defects, equipment damage, quality issues, screenshots

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Click "New Claim"** -> Select **"Image"**
2. **Upload photo** (from camera or file)
   - Take clear photo of issue
   - Include context (show full defect)
   - Good lighting helps accuracy
   - Can upload multiple images
3. **GPT-4 Vision extracts text** automatically:
   - Reads any text visible in image
   - Identifies visual defects
   - Attempts to extract relevant information
4. **Review extracted text** and make adjustments:
   - Edit if OCR missed something
   - Add description of what you see
   - Note location and impact
5. **Select category** (or accept AI suggestion)
6. **Submit**

**What happens:**
- Image analyzed for defects and text content
- Extracted information fed to AI for classification
- Original image stored for reference
- Claim created with image attached

**Tips for better image capture:**
- Take photo straight-on when possible
- Include scale reference (hand, ruler)
- Capture full defect in frame
- Ensure good lighting
- Note specific area if large image
- Take multiple photos from different angles

**Technical details:**
- Uses GPT-4 Vision for image analysis
- Extracts text via OCR
- Identifies visual patterns
- Works with PNG, JPG, WebP formats
- Max 10MB per image

### AI Auto-Classification

After submitting any claim type, Intelligate automatically processes it:

**Classification includes:**
- **Category**: Quality, Safety, Logistics, Maintenance, Other
- **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Root Cause Prediction**: Suggests likely causes (9 categories)
- **Confidence Score**: How certain the AI is (0-100%)
- **Sentiment**: Positive, Neutral, Negative (hints urgency)

**How to use classification:**
- **Review the AI suggestions** on claim detail page
- **Override if wrong**: Click to change category or priority
- **Note confidence**: Low confidence (<70%) may need review
- **Your correction trains AI**: Each override improves future predictions
- **Track patterns**: High override rate on a category suggests misconfiguration

### Multimodal Example

**Scenario**: Production line issue needs thorough documentation

1. **Start with voice** while on line: "Saw unusual noise from hydraulic pump, coming from Port side"
2. **Add image** of the pump location
3. **Add text** with additional context: "Noise started 2 hours ago, hydraulic pressure reading: 340 bar (normal 300-320)"
4. **Intelligate processes all input**:
   - Transcribes voice (gets location and symptom)
   - Analyzes image (confirms location)
   - Reads text details (provides diagnostic info)
   - Combines all for classification
5. **Result**: Highly accurate "Maintenance - Hydraulic System" classification with "High" priority

- Assigned team member
- Created by and date
- All attachments and evidence
- Complete activity log

**Visual indicators:**
- **RED** = Critical priority, Overdue SLA
- **ORANGE** = High priority, At-risk SLA
- **YELLOW** = Medium priority, On-time
- **GREEN** = Low priority, On-time

### Assigning Claims

**Assigning to team member:**
1. **Open claim** detail view
2. **Click "Assign to"** section
3. **Select team member** from list
4. **Selected member gets notification** immediately
5. **Status updates** on claim: "Assigned to John"

- Cannot reopen (creates new claim if issue returns)
- Stored in history for learning
- Final step: Complete workflow

**Status transition example:**
```
OPEN (just created)
  ->
(assign to John)
  ->
IN_PROGRESS (John starts work)
  ->
(John fixes issue)
  ->
RESOLVED (solution documented)

## Part 4: SLA & Deadline Management

### Understanding SLA

**SLA = Service Level Agreement** = Deadline to handle claim

**Example SLA Policy:**
| Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 8 hours |
| High | 8 hours | 24 hours |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours |
| Low | 48 hours | 1 week |

**What this means:**
- **Response Time**: Must acknowledge/assign within deadline
- **Resolution Time**: Must fully resolve within deadline
- **SLA Period**: Starts when claim created
- **Excludes**: Weekends/holidays (if configured)

### SLA Status Indicators

**On-Time** (Green)
- Claim is being handled within deadline
- Plenty of time remaining
- Status: "On Track"
- No action needed

**At-Risk** (Yellow)
- Deadline approaching (typically 2 hours remaining)
- Should prioritize this claim
- Time to take action before overdue
- Status: "Escalation Recommended"

**Overdue** (Red)
- Deadline has passed
- Immediate action needed
- May affect compliance metrics
- Status: "Breach - Requires Escalation"

### Deadline Calculation

**System automatically calculates:**
1. **Claim created**: March 15, 10:00 AM
2. **Priority assigned**: "High"
3. **SLA looked up**: High = 24 hour resolution
4. **Deadline set**: March 16, 10:00 AM
5. **Status monitored**: At-Risk at March 15, 8:00 PM (2 hours before)
6. **Alert sent**: "@Manager claim overdue" at March 16, 10:01 AM

**Customization:**
- SLA varies by category
- Example: Safety claims may have 4-hour SLA vs Quality 24-hour
- Can exclude weekends
- Can have custom rules per department

### Managing At-Risk Claims

**When you see yellow warning:**

1. **Assess status**: Is actual work happening?
2. **Communicate**: Add comment checking progress
3. **Support**: Offer help if person is stuck
4. **Escalate**: Move to someone with more availability
5. **Options**:
   - Add extra resources
   - Split into multiple claims
   - Escalate to manager for priority
   - Request external support

**Example intervention:**
```
Dashboard shows claim at-risk
  ->
Manager clicks claim
  ->
Sees John assigned, status still "OPEN"
  ->
Adds comment: "@John Heads up this is at-risk. Need help?"
  ->
John responds: "Yes, need access to Line 3"
  ->
Manager: "I'll arrange access. Switch to IN_PROGRESS while waiting."
  ->
John: "Done. Will start at 2 PM"
  ->
Status updated, on track now
```

### SLA Compliance Metrics

**Dashboard shows:**
- **Organization SLA Compliance**: % of all claims resolved on time
- **Department SLA Compliance**: By department (Quality, Maintenance, etc.)
- **Category SLA Compliance**: By claim type
- **Individual SLA Performance**: By team member
- **Trend Analysis**: Is compliance improving or declining?

**Interpreting metrics:**
- 95%+ compliance: Excellent process
- 85-95% compliance: Good, monitor trends
- 75-85% compliance: Needs improvement
- <75% compliance: Critical issues, investigate
