## Dashboard Overview

The Intelligate dashboard provides real-time visibility into your operations. Whether you're an executive needing strategic insights or a manager monitoring team performance, the dashboard adapts to your role.

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Total Claims

**Shows**: All claims in current period

- **Organization View** (Admin): All organization claims
- **Department View** (Manager): Department claims only
- **Personal View** (Employee): Claims you created

**Interpretation:**
- Increasing trend: Growing issue volume (hiring needed?)
- Decreasing trend: Process improvements working
- Seasonal patterns: Plan resource allocation
- Compare to previous period: Track growth/decline

**Actions:**
- Click to see claim list with filters
- Break down by department or category
- Analyze by priority level

### 2. Average Resolution Time

**Shows**: How long claims typically take from OPEN to CLOSED (in hours)

**Formula**: Sum of all resolution times ÷ Number of closed claims

**Example metrics:**
- 12 hours: Excellent - very responsive
- 24-48 hours: Good - reasonable turnaround
- 72+ hours: Investigate - may need process review

**What affects resolution time:**
- Claim complexity
- Team availability
- SLA policies
- Escalation frequency

**Actions:**
- Click to drill down by category
- See which categories take longest
- Identify bottlenecks
- Compare teams

### 3. SLA Compliance Rate

**Shows**: % of claims resolved on time

**Formula**: On-time claims ÷ Total claims × 100

**Example:**
- 95% compliance: Excellent
- 85% compliance: Good
- 75% compliance: Needs improvement
- <75%: Critical issue

**Trends to watch:**
- Declining compliance: Need more resources
- Specific category declining: Process issue
- Specific team declining: Training needed

**Actions:**
- Click to see which claims missed SLA
- Filter by category or department
- Identify common issues

### 4. Priority Distribution

**Shows**: Breakdown of claims by priority level

**Visualization**: Pie chart or bar chart
- 🔴 Critical: % (should be small, <5%)
- 🟠 High: % (typically 15-30%)
- 🟡 Medium: % (typically 40-50%)
- 🟢 Low: % (typically 20-30%)

**Healthy distribution:**
- Most claims Medium or Low
- Few Critical claims
- High priorities balanced

**Warning signs:**
- Too many Critical claims: Classification may be wrong
- Too many Low claims: May be missing urgent issues
- All High/Critical: Potential process chaos

**Actions:**
- Review how priorities assigned
- Check AI classification accuracy
- Retrain if pattern incorrect

### 5. Category Breakdown

**Shows**: Claims by type (Quality, Safety, Logistics, Maintenance)

**Example distribution:**
- Quality: 40%
- Maintenance: 25%
- Logistics: 20%
- Safety: 10%
- Other: 5%

**Interpretation:**
- Reflects operational reality of your facility
- Quality-heavy: Focus on manufacturing processes
- Maintenance-heavy: Equipment aging?
- Safety-focused: Good - safety priority

**Trends to watch:**
- Sudden increase in category: Root cause?
- Seasonal patterns: Weather, staffing, etc.
- New equipment = new category spike

**Actions:**
- Click category to drill down
- See all claims in category
- Analyze trends over time

### 6. Department Performance

**Shows**: How each department is performing

**Metrics per department:**
- Total claims in department
- Average resolution time
- SLA compliance %
- Workload (claims per person)
- Trending

**Interpretation:**
- Consistent high SLA: Well-managed team
- Declining SLA: Needs support
- High workload + low SLA: Hiring needed
- Low activity: Team tracking properly?

**Actions:**
- Click department to see details
- Compare departments against each other
- Identify star performers
- Support struggling teams

---

## Team Workload Overview

### Workload by Department

**Shows**: How work is distributed across departments

**Visualization**:
- Bar chart showing claims per department
- Stacked by status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
- Per-person averages

**Reading the chart:**
- OPEN column height: New work waiting
- IN_PROGRESS column: Active work
- Large OPEN stack: Bottleneck
- Small IN_PROGRESS: Maybe not working?

**Example:**
```
Quality     ████████ (40 claims) - 5 people = 8 each (good)
Maintenance ███████ (35 claims) - 3 people = 12 each (heavy)
Logistics   ████ (20 claims)    - 4 people = 5 each (light)
```

### Workload by Individual

**Shows**: Claims assigned to each person

**View:**
- List of team members
- Number of claims assigned
- Status breakdown per person
- Average resolution time per person

**Interpretation:**
- Balanced workload: 5-10 claims per person typically
- Over-assigned: >15 claims needs help
- Under-assigned: <3 claims check if untracked

**Actions:**
- Rebalance workload
- Identify top performers
- Support struggling team members
- Plan vacation coverage

### Capacity Planning

**Ask yourself:**
- Do we have enough people?
- Is workload distributed fairly?
- Who needs training?
- Who needs backup?
- When do we need to hire?

**Use dashboard data:**
1. Calculate average claims per person
2. See peak load times
3. Identify seasonal patterns
4. Plan hiring ahead of busy season

## Time-Series Analysis

### Claims Volume Trend

**Shows**: How many claims over time

**Time periods:**
- Daily: Last 30 days
- Weekly: Last 12 weeks
- Monthly: Last 12 months

**What to look for:**
- Upward trend: Growing issues or more reporting?
- Downward trend: Improvements working?
- Spikes: Something specific happened?
- Flat line: Stable operations

**Example:**
```
Claims/week
  40 │     ╱╲
  30 │    ╱  ╲    ╱╲
  20 │   ╱    ╲  ╱  ╲     New process
  10 │  ╱      ╲╱    ╲   implemented
   0 └─────────────────────
     Jan Feb Mar Apr May
```

### Resolution Time Trend

**Shows**: Is resolution getting faster or slower?

**Tracking:**
- Improving: Process getting better
- Declining: Maybe new staff less experienced?
- Stable: Consistent performance

**Cause investigation:**
- Staffing changes: New people slower initially
- Process changes: May help or hurt
- Equipment changes: Might affect repair time
- Seasonal: Holidays, weather impact

### SLA Compliance Trend

**Shows**: Meeting deadlines consistently?

**Healthy trend:**
- 90%+ consistently
- Small variations (85-95%)
- Upward movement: Good

**Concerning trend:**
- Below 80%
- Declining month over month
- Specific category dropping
- Specific team struggling

**Actions when SLA drops:**
1. What changed? (Staffing, process, volume)
2. Which claims are missing? (Category, department)
3. Can we fix quickly? (Add resources, simplify process)
4. Is it temporary or pattern? (Plan response accordingly)

### Category Trends

**Shows**: Are certain claim types increasing or decreasing?

**Questions to ask:**
- Quality increasing: Is manufacturing slipping?
- Safety increasing: Are hazards being discovered?
- Maintenance increasing: Equipment aging?
- Logistics increasing: Supply chain issues?

**Taking action:**
- Investigate root causes
- Make process changes
- Address systemic issues
- Celebrate improvements

## Troubleshooting Dashboard

### Metrics Seem Wrong

**Check these things:**
- Date range correct? (Make sure you're looking at right period)
- Filters applied? (Might be filtering out data)
- Timezone correct? (Timestamps in right zone)
- Claims marked properly? (Status and category correct)

### Missing Data

**Reasons:**
- Claims haven't been created yet (new organization)
- Time range too narrow (no data in that period)
- User permission limited (can't see some claims)
- Filters too restrictive

### Performance Slow

**Try:**
- Reduce time range (daily instead of yearly)
- Filter to specific department
- Close other browser tabs
- Refresh page
- Contact support if continues
