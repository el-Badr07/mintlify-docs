## Departments

Departments organize your teams and define how claims are routed throughout your organization.

### Standard Departments

Reclamia includes default departments ready to use:
- **PRODUCTION**: Production floor and operations
- **QUALITY_CONTROL**: Quality assurance team
- **MAINTENANCE**: Equipment and facility maintenance
- **LOGISTICS**: Shipping and supply chain
- **SAFETY**: Safety and compliance
- **HR**: Human resources (or custom)

### Adding Custom Departments

1. **Login to Reclamia** as admin
2. **Go to Settings** → **Organization** → **Departments**
3. **Click "Add Department"**
4. **Enter details**:
   - Department name
   - Assign department manager
   - Enable/disable in system
5. **Save** - department ready for use

### Department Configuration

**Manager Assignment:**
- Assign one or more managers to oversee the department
- Managers see all claims in their department
- Department metrics appear on their dashboard

**Team Members:**
- Assign employees to specific departments
- Employees see only their department's work
- Managers see all team members' workload

**Department Analytics:**
- Track claims per department
- Monitor resolution time and SLA compliance
- View workload distribution
- Identify trends and bottlenecks

## Categories

Categories organize claims by type and help route them effectively.

### Default Categories

- **Quality**: Quality issues and defects
- **Safety**: Incidents and hazards
- **Logistics**: Shipping and supply chain issues
- **Maintenance**: Equipment problems and repairs
- **Other**: Miscellaneous issues

### Creating Custom Categories

1. **Go to Settings** → **Organization** → **Categories**
2. **Click "Add Category"**
3. **Enter details**:
   - Category name (e.g., "Environmental")
   - Description
   - Assign to departments
   - Configure category-specific SLA
4. **Save** - category ready for use

### Best Practices

- **5-10 categories maximum**: Too many confuses users
- **Clear naming**: Use your operational terminology
- **Minimize "Other"**: Every claim should fit a clear category
- **Department alignment**: Categories match your departments
- **Regular review**: Adjust based on claim patterns

### Category Mapping

Map categories to departments for automatic routing:

| Category | Route To | Why |
|----------|----------|------|
| Quality | Quality department | Specialization |
| Safety | Safety + Notify Manager | Critical priority |
| Maintenance | Maintenance team | Equipment specialists |
| Logistics | Logistics team | Supply chain experts |

---

## SLA Policies

Service Level Agreements define deadlines for handling claims based on priority and category.

### SLA Components

**Response Time**: How quickly a claim must be acknowledged or assigned
- Example: Critical = 4 hours
- Example: Low = 48 hours

**Resolution Time**: How quickly a claim must be fully resolved
- Example: Critical = 8 hours
- Example: Low = 1 week

### Default SLA Policy

| Priority | Response | Resolution | Escalation |
|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Critical | 4 hours | 8 hours | 2 hours if not assigned |
| High | 8 hours | 24 hours | 4 hours if not assigned |
| Medium | 24 hours | 72 hours | Escalate if at-risk |
| Low | 48 hours | 1 week | Manual review |

### Customizing SLAs

1. **Go to Settings** → **Organization** → **SLA Policies**
2. **Select priority level**
3. **Set response and resolution times**
4. **Configure escalation triggers**
5. **Save** - SLA active

### Override by Category

Different categories may need different SLAs:
- **Safety claims**: May need faster response (4-hour response)
- **Maintenance claims**: May need extra time for parts (48-hour resolution)
- **Logistics claims**: May have different timelines (6-hour response)

### Exclusions

Configure when the SLA clock pauses:
- Weekends and holidays
- Business hours only
- Maintenance windows

Example: "Resolve by Monday 9 AM" when created Friday 5 PM.

### SLA Monitoring

Your dashboard shows:
- Overall SLA compliance rate
- Claims at-risk or overdue
- Department SLA performance
- Category SLA comparison

### Tips

- **Start conservative**: Longer SLAs initially, then tighten
- **Monitor performance**: Adjust based on actual data
- **Category-specific rules**: Different categories need different timelines
- **Account for complexity**: Complex issues need more time
- **Quarterly review**: Keep SLAs realistic

## Escalation Rules

Escalation rules automatically promote claims up the chain when needed.

### When to Escalate

- Claim approaching SLA deadline
- No one assigned after X hours
- Critical priority not addressed
- Safety concern requires executive attention
- Cross-department issue needs coordination

### Creating Escalation Rules

1. **Go to Settings** → **Organization** → **Escalation Rules**
2. **Click "Add Rule"**
3. **Set trigger conditions**:
   - Priority = Critical
   - Category = Safety
   - Open > 2 hours without assignment
4. **Set escalation action**:
   - Escalate to department manager
   - Escalate to director
   - Notify department head
5. **Save and test** with sample claim

### Common Escalation Scenarios

**Unassigned Critical Claims:**
- Trigger: Critical priority + no assignment after 1 hour
- Action: Escalate to department manager
- Effect: Ensures critical claims get attention fast

**SLA At-Risk Claims:**
- Trigger: SLA status = At-Risk (2 hours before deadline)
- Action: Notify assignee + add to manager dashboard
- Effect: Proactive intervention before deadline

**Safety Claims:**
- Trigger: Category = Safety AND Priority = High
- Action: Auto-escalate to Safety Manager + email officers
- Effect: Safety gets priority treatment

**Cross-Department Issues:**
- Trigger: Mentions multiple departments
- Action: Escalate to Operations Director
- Effect: Executive alignment

### Escalation Chain Example

```
Level 1: Assigned person works on it
    ↓ (if not assigned in 2 hours)
Level 2: Department manager notified
    ↓ (if still not resolved in 4 hours)
Level 3: Operations director takes over
    ↓ (if still open next day)
Level 4: Executive review for process change
```

### Monitoring Escalations

Your dashboard shows:
- Escalations per week
- Which rules trigger most
- Escalation success rate
- Patterns in escalations

High escalation rates suggest:
- Insufficient resources
- Process issues
- Unclear procedures
- Training needs
