## Business Rules Overview

Create rules to automatically handle claims according to your business logic.

### Common Rules

**Auto-Routing:**
- If category = Quality → Route to Quality dept
- If priority = Critical → Auto-assign to manager
- If department = Maintenance → Route to specialized team

**Escalation:**
- If open > 2 hours and not assigned → Escalate
- If high priority not assigned in 4 hours → Notify manager
- If overdue → Alert director

**Notification:**
- If critical → Email entire department
- If safety → @mention safety officer
- If escalated → Copy executive

### Creating a Rule

1. **Name**: "Auto-route Quality Claims"
2. **Trigger**: If category = "Quality"
3. **Actions**: 
   - Route to Quality department
   - Assign to John (quality lead)
   - Send notification
4. **Save & Test**

### Rule Management

- **Enable/Disable**: Turn rules on/off
- **Priority**: Rules execute in order
- **Test**: Run against sample claims
- **Monitor**: See which claims triggered rule
- **Adjust**: Update based on results

## Use Cases

### Situation: Too many unassigned claims

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Claim open > 1 hour and not assigned
- Action: Auto-assign to next available person in department

### Situation: Critical claims need immediate attention

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Priority = Critical
- Action: 
  - Email manager
  - @mention director
  - Add to dashboard red alert

### Situation: Specific categories always escalate

**Rule:**
- Trigger: Category = "Safety" and priority = "High"
- Action: Auto-escalate to executive + notify compliance
