## Managing Users

User management happens primarily in Keycloak. Intelligate reads user data from Keycloak and syncs it automatically.

### Adding New Users

**Via Keycloak Admin Console:**
1. Go to `https://api.64.226.86.247.sslip.io/keycloak`
2. Navigate to Users section
3. Create new user with username, email
4. Set temporary password (user changes on first login)
5. Assign roles: admin, manager, employee
6. User receives email and joins organization

**Via Self-Signup:**
1. Users visit signup page
2. Select organization from list
3. Create account with email/password
4. Receive EMPLOYEE role by default
5. Can be promoted by admin later

### Assigning Roles

Roles are assigned in Keycloak and synced to Intelligate:
- **ADMIN**: Full system access
- **MANAGER**: Department oversight
- **EMPLOYEE**: Daily claim management

**To change role:**
1. Edit user in Keycloak
2. Update role assignments
3. Role takes effect on next login

### Department Assignment

In Intelligate admin console:
1. Go to Organization Settings
2. Select user
3. Assign to department (Production, Quality, Maintenance, etc.)
4. Department determines workload visibility

### User Status

Users can be:
- **Active**: Can login and work
- **Inactive**: Cannot login (admin can reactivate)
- **Pending**: Invitation sent, awaiting response
