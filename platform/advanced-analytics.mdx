## Root Cause Analysis

Intelligate tracks the root causes AI assigns to claims. Over time, patterns emerge showing systemic issues.

**Use cases:**
- "Sensor calibration" appears 7 times → automate calibration
- "Training gap" in safety → implement training program
- "Supplier quality" repeated → change suppliers

## Repeat Issue Identification

The system flags claims that appear repeatedly:

1. **Query**: Find all claims with same category + similar description
2. **Pattern analysis**: Group similar issues
3. **Trend line**: How often occurring and changing

**Example**: 
- Conveyor belt tension issues: 5 times in 6 months
- Solution: Automated tension monitoring prevents future occurrences

## Category Performance

Deep analysis by claim type:

- Volume trends
- Average resolution time
- SLA compliance by category
- Most common causes
- Seasonal patterns

## Department Efficiency

Compare departments on:
- Claims per person (productivity)
- Average resolution time (speed)
- SLA compliance (reliability)
- First-time fix rate (quality)

## Benchmarking

Compare your organization against:
- Previous periods (trending)
- Other departments
- Industry standards
- Best practices
