## Quality Defect Management

### Scenario
A quality inspector discovers a manufacturing defect in the production line. Instead of filling out multiple forms, they:

1. **Capture the issue** via the mobile app using a voice note while on the production floor
2. **Add photos** of the defective unit for documentation
3. Intelligate **automatically classifies** it as "Quality" with "High" priority based on defect type
4. **Routes to Quality Manager** in real-time
5. Quality team receives **instant notification** with full context
6. Comments and escalation tracking ensure **rapid resolution**

### Benefits
- Defects documented in minutes instead of hours
- AI classification ensures consistent categorization
- Management visibility enables immediate response
- Historical defect tracking prevents recurring issues

---

## Safety Incident Response

### Scenario
A safety incident occurs on the factory floor. A supervisor needs to report it immediately:

1. **Creates text claim** from phone with incident details (what happened, who was involved, severity)
2. Intelligate **automatically routes** to Safety Manager with "Critical" priority
3. **Escalation chain** triggered automatically due to Critical priority
4. Multiple safety team members receive **@mention notifications**
5. Team **collaborates** in the claim with comments and files
6. **Complete incident log** available for compliance and investigation

### Benefits
- Immediate incident documentation for safety compliance
- Automatic escalation ensures no critical incidents slip through
- Collaboration prevents communication gaps
- Full audit trail satisfies regulatory requirements

## Logistics Issue Tracking

### Scenario
A shipping delay occurs affecting multiple orders. A logistics coordinator reports it:

1. **Voice claim** created while on the phone with supplier: "Shipment delayed 48 hours"
2. Groq Whisper automatically **transcribes** the voice recording
3. Intelligate **classifies** as "Logistics" with "Medium" priority
4. **Auto-routes** to Logistics Manager
5. Team uses **Kanban board** to track progress
6. **Comments** track communication with suppliers
7. Resolution documented for future supplier performance reviews

### Benefits
- Quick reporting during active problem-solving
- Automatic transcription removes documentation burden
- Visibility prevents cascade failures
- Historical data informs supplier management

---

## Maintenance Request Management

### Scenario
Equipment breaks down in the facility. Operator needs to request maintenance:

1. **Creates image claim** - takes photo of broken equipment and machine display
2. GPT-4 Vision automatically **extracts text** from machine display (error codes)
3. **Root cause prediction** based on error codes and historical maintenance
4. **Routes to Maintenance team** with suggested solutions
5. Maintenance specialist checks **historical claims** for similar equipment issues
6. Uses **comments** to request clarification from operator
7. **Activity log** tracks maintenance history for predictive maintenance

### Benefits
- Visual documentation prevents miscommunication
- AI suggestions speed up troubleshooting
- Historical context reduces resolution time
- Data informs predictive maintenance planning

## Cross-Department Escalation

### Scenario
A customer complaint involves quality issue that might also be a logistics problem. Report flows through multiple departments:

1. **Employee creates text claim**: "Customer received damaged product"
2. Intelligate **classifies** as "Quality" with "High" priority initially
3. Quality Manager reviews and **adds comment**: "Also appears to be shipping damage"
4. **Escalates claim** to both Quality and Logistics managers
5. **Cross-functional collaboration** via comments and file attachments
6. Claim status moves through both workflows
7. **Root cause** determined: Quality defect + Logistics damage
8. **Combined resolution** addresses both issues

### Benefits
- Complex issues tracked in single location, not scattered emails
- No duplicated effort or communication gaps
- Clear ownership even with multiple departments
- Complete record for learning and prevention

---

## SLA Compliance Monitoring

### Scenario
Manager needs to monitor team SLA performance:

1. **Dashboard shows** 23 open claims, 78% SLA compliance rate
2. **At-Risk indicator** shows 4 claims approaching deadline (yellow warning)
3. Manager **uses Kanban board** to see which claims need attention
4. **Clicks on at-risk claim** and sees full context and assignee
5. **Adds comment** to provide support or reassign if needed
6. **Comments trigger notification** to assignee
7. **SLA status updated** as work progresses

### Benefits
- Proactive management prevents breaches
- Visual indicators surface problems early
- One-click access to full context
- Historical SLA data informs workload planning

---

## Analytics for Process Improvement

### Scenario
Operations Director needs data to improve processes:

1. **Pulls dashboard** showing all-time metrics
2. **Trends analysis** reveals quality defects increased 15% in March
3. **Category breakdown** shows increase concentrated in Assembly department
4. **Root cause analysis** available from past claims
5. **Exports data to CSV** for detailed spreadsheet analysis
6. **Generates PDF report** for executive presentation
7. Data reveals **process change in early March** correlates with issue spike

### Benefits
- Data-driven insights guide process improvements
- Historical trends prevent reactive decisions
- Easy export supports analysis workflows
- Board-ready reports enable strategic decisions

---

## Knowledge Base Integration

### Scenario
Maintenance team encounters recurring equipment failure:

1. Technician **uses chat assistant** to search knowledge base
2. **Queries**: "What's the fix for motor bearing noise on Line 3?"
3. Assistant **retrieves relevant procedures** from knowledge base
4. **Links to similar historical claims** with solutions
5. **Steps from past resolution** help current technician
6. **Faster resolution** thanks to institutional knowledge

### Benefits
- Reduces time to resolution
- Prevents re-learning past problems
- Captures institutional knowledge
- Trains new team members

## First-Time Configuration (Admin)

### Scenario
New manufacturer wants to implement Intelligate:

1. Admin **sets up organization** with company details
2. **Configures SSO** to use existing corporate credentials (Keycloak)
3. **Creates departments**: Production, Quality, Logistics, Maintenance, Safety
4. **Defines categories** specific to manufacturing: Defect, Downtime, Delay, Incident, Other
5. **Sets SLA policies**:
   - Critical: 4-hour response, 8-hour resolution
   - High: 8-hour response, 24-hour resolution
   - Medium: 24-hour response, 72-hour resolution
   - Low: 48-hour response, 1-week resolution
6. **Creates business rules** for auto-routing
7. **Configures AI agents** for different departments
8. **Imports knowledge base** from existing documentation

### Benefits
- Quick onboarding with guided setup
- Standardized processes from day one
- AI agents immediately useful
- Team adoption faster with familiar processes
