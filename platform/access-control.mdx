## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Reclamia enforces access control based on user roles defined in Keycloak.

### Permission Matrix

| Action | Admin | Manager | Employee |
|--------|-------|---------|----------|
| Create Claim | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View All Claims | ✅ | Dept only | Own only |
| Assign Claim | ✅ | Dept only | No |
| Change Priority | ✅ | Dept only | No |
| Create Business Rule | ✅ | Dept only | No |
| Access Admin Console | ✅ | No | No |
| Manage Users | ✅ | No | No |
| View Analytics | ✅ | Dept only | No |
| Create AI Agent | ✅ | No | No |

### Organization Isolation

- Users only see claims from their organization
- Cannot access other organizations' data
- Department filtering applies within organization
- Admin can see entire organization

### Department-Level Access

- Managers see only their department's claims
- Employees see only assigned claims
- Cannot view other departments' claims
- Unless specifically collaborated on
