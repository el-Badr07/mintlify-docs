## Agent Effectiveness Metrics

Track per agent:
- **Usage frequency**: How often called
- **User satisfaction**: Are responses helpful?
- **Accuracy**: Are suggestions correct?
- **Time saved**: How much faster with agent?
- **Actions taken**: Do users implement suggestions?

Adjust agents based on metrics:
- Low usage: Agent not solving real problem
- Low satisfaction: Improve system prompt or knowledge base
- High accuracy: Keep as is, share best practices
- High satisfaction: Consider expanding scope
