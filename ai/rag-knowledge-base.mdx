## What is RAG?

**RAG = Retrieval Augmented Generation**

Instead of AI making up answers, it retrieves relevant documents and uses those to generate responses.

## How RAG Works

**Without RAG** (hallucination risk):
```
Question: "What's our conveyor belt maintenance schedule?"
AI thinks: "I think we maintain conveyors monthly..."
Result: Guessed answer (might be wrong!)
```

**With RAG** (grounded in facts):
```
Question: "What's our conveyor belt maintenance schedule?"
System retrieves: "Conveyor maintenance schedule.pdf"
AI reads: "Monthly oil changes, quarterly belt inspection..."
Result: Accurate answer grounded in documentation
```

## RAG Benefits

 **Accuracy**: Answers grounded in real documents
 **Consistency**: Same procedures every time
 **Current**: Uses latest documentation
 **Traceable**: Can cite sources
 **Preventive**: Reduces hallucinations
## Knowledge Base Structure

### By Department

**Quality Department**
- Quality control procedures
- Defect classification guide
- Testing standards
- Historical resolutions

**Maintenance Department**
- Equipment manuals
- Maintenance schedules
- Troubleshooting guides
- Parts specifications

**Safety Department**
- Safety procedures
- Emergency response plans
- OSHA standards
- Incident protocols

**Logistics Department**
- Shipping procedures
- Supplier contacts
- Inventory management
- Delivery standards

### By Document Type

**Procedures**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Standard operating procedures
- Process flows
- Checklists

**Guides**
- Troubleshooting guides
- How-to documents
- Best practices
- Training materials

**Reference**
- Equipment specs
- Part numbers
- Contact information
- Standards documents

**Historical**
- Past resolutions
- Case studies
- Lessons learned
- Success stories

## Building Knowledge Base

### Gathering Documents

1. **Existing documentation**:
   - Company procedures
   - Training materials
   - Equipment manuals
   - Policy documents

2. **Historical data**:
   - Past resolved claims (the "why" and solution)
   - Maintenance logs
   - Quality records
   - Safety incidents

3. **External resources**:
   - Industry standards
   - OSHA guidelines
   - Supplier documentation
   - Regulatory requirements

### Tagging Documents

Add metadata for search:
- Department: Quality, Maintenance, Safety, Logistics
- Category: Procedure, Guide, Reference, Historical
- Tags: Conveyor, Hydraulic, Safety, etc.
- Last updated: Date
- Version: Current, Archived

## Using RAG in Agents

### Automatic Retrieval

When user asks agent question:
1. System searches knowledge base
2. Finds relevant documents (usually top 3-5)
3. Passes to AI along with question
4. AI uses documents to generate response
5. Provides citation: "Per Maintenance Schedule v2.3"

### Citation & Traceability

Responses include:
- Direct answers
- Source documents
- Relevant procedures
- Links to full documents

Example:
```
Q: "How often should we calibrate the press?"
A: "Every 30 days per Equipment Manual Section 4.2.
   Last calibration: Jan 15, 2025.
   Next due: Feb 15, 2025.
   See: press_calibration_guide.pdf"
```

## Maintaining Knowledge Base

### Monthly Review
- Update changed procedures
- Add new learnings from recent claims
- Fix broken links
- Update contact information

### Quarterly Audit
- Verify all procedures still current
- Identify gaps (questions not answerable)
- Remove obsolete documents
- Reorganize if needed

### When Processes Change
- Update relevant documents IMMEDIATELY
- Notify team of changes
- Retrain agents if needed
- Archive old versions

## Knowledge Base Quality

Good knowledge base indicators:
-  Agents provide accurate answers
-  Users find helpful information
-  Few "I don't know" responses
-  Consistent procedures
-  Up-to-date information
Poor knowledge base indicators:
-  Agents struggle to answer questions
-  Users can't find information
-  Conflicting procedures documented
-  Outdated information causing errors
-  Gaps in coverage

## Improving RAG Performance

**If AI doesn't find answers:**
- Add missing documents
- Improve document titles and tags
- Break large documents into sections
- Add more examples

**If AI gives wrong answers:**
- Review and update procedures
- Remove conflicting documents
- Clarify ambiguous instructions
- Add context to procedures
