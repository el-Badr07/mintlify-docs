## What Are AI Agents?

Agents are specialized AI assistants configured for specific purposes. Each agent has:
- Specific role (Quality Assistant, Safety Expert, etc.)
- System instructions (personality and behavior)
- Available tools (what it can do)
- Knowledge base (documents to reference)
- Permitted data access (what it can see)

## Step-by-Step Agent Creation

### Step 1: Define Purpose

**Question**: What will this agent help with?

Examples:
- "Quality defect classification and root cause analysis"
- "Safety incident response and escalation"
- "Maintenance troubleshooting and scheduling"

### Step 2: Write System Prompt

Instructions for agent behavior:

Example Quality Agent:
```
You are a Quality Control Expert. Your job is to:
- Help classify quality defects
- Suggest root causes
- Recommend quality improvements
- Reference industry standards
- Escalate safety concerns
- Use data-driven decisions
Be professional, direct, and action-oriented.
```

### Step 3: Select LLM Provider

Choose model based on needs:
- **OpenRouter**: General classification
- **Groq**: Audio processing
- **OpenAI**: Complex analysis

### Step 4: Configure Tools

Select what agent can access:

Available tools:
- Search claims with filters
- Get full claim details
- View analytics/KPIs
- Check SLA status
- Access knowledge base
- Query team workload
- Generate reports

### Step 5: Link Knowledge Base

Attach documents agent should reference:
- Quality control procedures
- Equipment manuals
- Historical resolutions
- Best practices
- Training materials

### Step 6: Test Agent

Ask sample questions:
- "What causes conveyor belt misalignment?"
- "Show me quality issues from last week"
- "What's our SLA compliance rate?"
- "How many critical claims unassigned?"

Verify:
- Answers are accurate
- Tone is appropriate
- References are helpful
- No hallucinations

## Agent Examples

### Quality Defect Assistant

**Purpose**: Help quality team
**System Prompt**: "Focus on defects, root causes, prevention"
**Tools**: Search claims, analytics, knowledge base
**Knowledge Base**: Quality procedures, defect types, solutions
**Access**: Quality department claims only

### Safety Incident Responder

**Purpose**: Support safety incidents
**System Prompt**: "Treat as urgent, escalate appropriately, focus on prevention"
**Tools**: Search claims, escalation, notifications
**Knowledge Base**: Safety procedures, OSHA regulations, response playbooks
**Access**: All claims (some sensitive)

### Maintenance Specialist

**Purpose**: Equipment troubleshooting
**System Prompt**: "Provide step-by-step solutions, reference equipment manuals"
**Tools**: Search claims, get details, view workload
**Knowledge Base**: Equipment specs, maintenance schedules, past repairs
**Access**: Maintenance claims + historical records

### Executive Summary Agent

**Purpose**: Quick metrics for leadership
**System Prompt**: "Provide concise summaries, focus on trends and decisions"
**Tools**: Full analytics access
**Knowledge Base**: Company goals, KPI definitions
**Access**: All data (aggregate level)

## Managing Agents

### Enable/Disable
- Start with disabled
- Enable after testing
- Disable if not used
- Can toggle anytime

### Monitor Usage
- How often called
- Average response time
- User satisfaction
- Common queries

### Update Agents
- Refine system prompt based on feedback
- Add new tools or knowledge
- Change LLM provider if needed
- Archive if unused

### Remove Agents
- Delete when no longer needed
- Archive for reference
- Export interactions if needed

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Start with clear, specific purpose
- Use professional system prompt
- Thoroughly test before deploying
- Link to good knowledge base
- Monitor usage and adjust
- Gather user feedback
- Update documentation regularly

❌ **Don't**:
- Create too many agents (causes confusion)
- Make agents too generic
- Deploy without testing
- Forget to update knowledge base
- Ignore user feedback
- Leave unused agents enabled
