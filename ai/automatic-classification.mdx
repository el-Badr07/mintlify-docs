## How AI Classifies Claims

Every claim is automatically analyzed and classified. You can review and override classifications.

## What Gets Classified

- **Category**: Quality, Safety, Logistics, Maintenance, Other
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Root Cause**: From 9 possible causes
- **Sentiment**: Positive, Neutral, Negative

## Classification Process

1. **Input Processing**:
   - If text: Analyze directly
   - If voice: Transcribe first, then analyze
   - If image: Extract text via OCR, then analyze

2. **Analysis**:
   - Identify keywords and patterns
   - Match against historical data
   - Consider context and urgency
   - Predict likely causes

3. **Scoring**:
   - Calculate confidence level (0-100%)
   - Identify similar past claims
   - Rank possible categories
   - Assign most likely classification

4. **Presentation**:
   - Show AI suggestion
   - Display confidence score
   - Show alternative options
   - Allow user override

## Confidence Scoring

**90-100%**: Very confident, usually correct
- Example: "Chemical spill" -> Safety, Critical, 98%

**70-90%**: Confident but verify
- Example: "Equipment noise" -> Maintenance, High, 82%

**50-70%**: Uncertain, review carefully
- Example: "Strange behavior" -> Could be multiple categories

**<50%**: Very uncertain, likely needs manual review
- Example: Ambiguous description -> Unknown category, 35%

## Using AI Classifications

### Accept Classification
- Click checkmark to accept
- Claim created with AI suggestion
- System learns from acceptance

### Override Classification
- Click to change category/priority
- Select correct classification
- Your correction trains AI
- Next time, AI more likely to get it right

### Provide Feedback
- Is classification reasonable? (like/dislike)
- User feedback improves AI
- High dislike rate triggers review

## Improving Classifications

### Feedback Loop
Each override helps train AI:
- User sees wrong classification
- Corrects it
- AI learns pattern
- Future similar claims classified better

### Pattern Recognition
AI identifies patterns:
- "Conveyor" + keywords -> Maintenance
- "Injured" + urgency -> Safety
- "Delivery" + status -> Logistics

### Historical Learning
AI improves by seeing:
- What was classified before
- How it was resolved
- Patterns in resolutions
- Seasonal trends

## Common Classification Mistakes

### Too Many "Critical" Classifications

**Problem**: AI classifies too many claims as Critical
**Solution**: Adjust confidence threshold higher or review AI keywords for "urgent"

### Missing Safety Issues

**Problem**: Safety claims classified as Quality
**Solution**: Add safety keywords to knowledge base or adjust system prompt

### Wrong Department Routing

**Problem**: Maintenance claims routing to Quality
**Solution**: Review category-to-department mapping

## AI Confidence for Different Inputs

**Text claims**: Usually 75-90% confidence
- Clear descriptions: Higher confidence
- Vague descriptions: Lower confidence

**Voice claims**: Usually 70-85% confidence
- Clear speech: Better confidence
- Background noise: Lower confidence
- Accents: Varies by model

**Image claims**: Usually 60-80% confidence
- Clear images: Better confidence
- Blurry images: Lower confidence
- Requires context text
